** Convert hex to base64
   2015-11-01
   Base64 uses 6 bits, vs normal hex (Base16) which uses 4. Need to
   convert bytes (8 bits, Base256) to 6 bit words. Best conversion is
   24 bits which is 3x8 and 4x6.

   Break byte array into hexlets.
   Next: need to refactor convert-hexlet!
   Saw an interesting way to manage the Base64code. Make an array of
   all characters
